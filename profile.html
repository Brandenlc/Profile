		<h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
		<p class="aboutp"><img src="img/portrait.jpg">I am an African American high school student born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm currently enrolled in Rowland Hall and I hope to got to college in the University of Utah. I have an autism spectrum disorder known Asperger Syndrome that assists me, hinders me, and challenges me. Asperger's has brought forth more and more challenges over the years, but as I've learned to adapt myself and better myself, some of them have become assets. For example, Asperger's has let me be extremely passionate for my hobbies and whenever I have the time away from schoolwork, I give them an intense focus. For example, coding has become something I've come to appreciate and enjoy. It's a newfound challenge that I'm ready to tackle.</p>
